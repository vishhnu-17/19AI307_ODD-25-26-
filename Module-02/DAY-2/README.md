## AIM:
To write a Java program to find the cube of a number using methods.

## ALGORITHM :
1. Start the program.
2. Read an integer `n` from the user.
3. Define a method `square()` to calculate the square of a number.
4. Define a method `cube()` that uses `square()` to calculate the cube of the number.
5. Display the cube of the given number and stop the program.




## PROGRAM:
 ```
/*
Program to implement a Methods using Java
Developed by: Kurapati Vishnu Vardhan Reddy
RegisterNumber: 212223040103
*/
```

## SOURCE CODE:

```
import java.util.*;
public class main{
    static int square(int x){
        return x*x;
    }
    static int cube(int x){
        return x*square(x);
    }
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        System.out.println(cube(n));
    }
}

```
